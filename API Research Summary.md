- **Limitations:** Commercial API, requires subscription for full access. Free access might have significant limitations on data volume or real-time updates.

## Potential Data Gaps and Strategies:
- **Comprehensive Energy Indicators:** While EIA provides good energy data, ensuring global coverage for all required energy indicators (production, consumption, reserves by country) might require cross-referencing with World Bank or other sources.
- **Detailed Military Data:** SIPRI is excellent for military expenditure and arms transfers, but detailed military force structure or capabilities might require additional research from other defense-related databases or reports.
- **Non-State Actor Data:** ACLED and UCDP cover conflict events involving non-state actors, but comprehensive profiles or specific data points on their organizational structure, funding, or detailed influence networks might be limited through these APIs alone. Additional qualitative research or specialized datasets might be needed.
- **Alliance Network Granularity:** While some APIs might indicate alliances, building a detailed 




## Data Gap Analysis and Proposed Strategies:

### Military Indicators:
- **Coverage:** SIPRI provides excellent data on military expenditure and arms transfers. However, detailed information on specific military capabilities, force structures, or weapon systems for individual countries beyond general spending might be limited through publicly available APIs.
- **Gap:** Granular data on military strength beyond expenditure (e.g., number of active personnel, specific equipment types, technological capabilities).
- **Strategy:** For the purpose of a high-level power index, SIPRI's expenditure and arms transfer data should be sufficient. If more detailed military data is required for specific analyses, it might necessitate manual data collection from open-source intelligence (OSINT) reports, defence analyses, or academic databases, which is beyond the scope of direct API integration for this project.

### Economic Indicators:
- **Coverage:** World Bank and IMF provide comprehensive economic data, including GDP, trade, inflation, and various financial indicators. These should cover the 'economic power' aspect adequately.
- **Gap:** None identified for general economic indicators.
- **Strategy:** Utilize World Bank and IMF APIs for economic data. Ensure consistent data definitions and methodologies when combining data from both sources.

### Demographic Indicators:
- **Coverage:** World Bank provides demographic data such as population, birth rates, death rates, and migration. This should be sufficient for 'demographic indicators'.
- **Gap:** None identified for general demographic indicators.
- **Strategy:** Use World Bank API for demographic data.

### Energy Indicators:
- **Coverage:** EIA provides extensive data on energy production, consumption, and reserves, primarily for the U.S. and some international data. World Bank also has some energy-related indicators.
- **Gap:** Comprehensive global coverage for all types of energy resources (oil, gas, renewables) and their production/consumption/reserves for all relevant countries in the Middle East. EIA's focus is primarily U.S.-centric.
- **Strategy:** Prioritize EIA for U.S. data and cross-reference with World Bank or other specialized energy data providers (if available via API) for broader international coverage. For the Middle East, specific regional energy reports might be necessary if API data is insufficient.

### Alliances & Influence Networks:
- **Coverage:** No single API directly provides a comprehensive, dynamic dataset of geopolitical alliances and influence networks with the desired granularity (links between states and non-state actors). GDELT might capture some related events, but constructing a full network would be challenging.
- **Gap:** A structured, real-time dataset detailing formal and informal alliances, diplomatic ties, military cooperation agreements, and influence pathways between states and non-state actors.
- **Strategy:** This will likely require a hybrid approach. Initial data could be manually curated from reputable geopolitical analysis sources (e.g., think tanks, academic papers, news archives) to establish a baseline network. GDELT could then be used to identify events that might indicate strengthening or weakening of these ties, allowing for dynamic updates. The 'alliance network centrality' for the Power Index will need to be derived from this constructed network.

### Conflict Indicators:
- **Coverage:** ACLED and UCDP are excellent sources for conflict events, providing location, actors, dates, and intensity. These are ideal for 'Conflict Zones' and 'conflict intensity' for the Power Index.
- **Gap:** None identified for conflict events.
- **Strategy:** Utilize ACLED and UCDP APIs for conflict data. Combine and de-duplicate data as necessary to create a comprehensive conflict event dataset.

### Non-State Actors:
- **Coverage:** ACLED and UCDP identify non-state actors involved in conflicts. GDELT also tracks events related to various organizations.
- **Gap:** Detailed profiles, organizational structures, funding sources, and specific operational areas for non-state actors beyond their involvement in conflict events.
- **Strategy:** For the 'Actors Module', initial profiles will be built using information available from ACLED, UCDP, and general web research. Deeper dives into specific non-state actors might require manual research and synthesis of information from various reports and news sources. The 'influence networks' part of the alliances will also contribute to understanding non-state actors' roles.

### Overall Data Integration Strategy:
- **Prioritize APIs:** Leverage the identified APIs (ACLED, UCDP, GDELT, World Bank, IMF, EIA, MarineTraffic, OpenSky Network) as primary data sources.
- **Hybrid Approach for Gaps:** For areas with data gaps (e.g., detailed military capabilities, comprehensive alliance networks, in-depth non-state actor profiles), combine API data with curated open-source information. This curated data can be stored locally or in a separate database.
- **Data Normalization and Harmonization:** Implement robust data processing pipelines to normalize and harmonize data from diverse sources, ensuring consistency in country codes, actor names, and temporal data.
- **Update Frequency:** Establish a clear update frequency for each data source, noting that some (like OpenSky/MarineTraffic) are real-time, while others (like World Bank/IMF) are updated periodically.

This analysis confirms that while most core data points are accessible via APIs, certain nuanced aspects like detailed military capabilities and comprehensive, dynamic alliance networks will require a hybrid approach combining API data with curated open-source intelligence. This approach is feasible within the project scope.
